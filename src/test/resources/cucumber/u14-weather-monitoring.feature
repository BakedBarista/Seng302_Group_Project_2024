Feature: U14 As Kaia, I want to know the current and future weather at my gardens, so I know if I need to water them

  Background:
    Given I am logged in as "Kaia"
    And My email is "Kaia@gmail.com"
    And My password is "P@ssw0rd"
    And I have a garden in "Christchurch", "New Zealand"

  Scenario: AC1 Display the weather

#  AC1 Given I am on the garden details page for a garden I own, then the current weather (including the current day of the week, date, description i.e. sunny, overcast, raining with a relevant image, temperature and humidity) for my location is shown.
#  AC2 Given I am on the garden details page for a garden I own, then the future weather (including the day of the week, date, description i.e. sunny, overcast, raining with a relevant image, temperature and humidity) for the future (3 to 5 days) is shown.
#  AC3 Given the garden has a location that can’t be found, then an error message tells me “Location not found, please update your location to see the weather”.
#  AC4 Given the past two days have been sunny, when I am on my garden details page, then a highlighted element tells me “There hasn’t been any rain recently, make sure to water your plants if they need it”.
#  AC5 Given the current weather is rainy, when I am on my garden details page, then a highlighted element tells me “Outdoor plants don’t need any water today”.
#  AC6 Given an element tells me I should or shouldn’t water my plants, when I click the “x” or “close” button at the top right of the element, then the element is dismissed and does not show up for that garden until the next day.
